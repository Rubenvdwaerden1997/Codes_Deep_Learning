### Codes_Deep_Learning
In this repository, some example codes are added which are used to derive the blood pressure out of a PPG signal.
3 different models are built:
- CNN model <br>
  --> Deriving DBP, SBP and MAP out of one normalized PPG waveform_
- LSTM model_
  --> Deriving one blood pressure waveform out of one normalized PPG waveform
  --> Deriving 3 seconds of blood pressure out of 3 seconds of PPG
- CNN+LSTM model
  --> Deriving DBP and SBP out of 2 seconds of PPG
